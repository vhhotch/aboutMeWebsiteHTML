        <h2>Why I joined Code Nation</h2>
        <img src="/img/Long-logo-c.png" alt="Code Nation Logo">
        <p>I joined Code Nation as an apprentice for EMIS. I was really lucky to get the position - I had little tech knowledge, but a whole load of passion and enthusiam to learn!</p>

        <h2>Code Nation so far...</h2>
        <p>The first two weeks at Code Nation have been challenging but enjoyable. We've focussed on Javascript and coding fundamentals and ended week 2 with our own project to complete. Week 3 is changing focus as we move to understand HTML and CSS better.</p>
        <p>I originally started coding after I attended a one day <a href="https://djangogirls.org" target="blank">Django Girls</a> event.... at Code Nation! </p>
